### How to contribute

The font sources are available in [UFO](http://unifiedfontobject.org/) format,
which is understood by most popular font editors (FontForge, Glyphs, etc.).

We use [fontmake](https://github.com/googlei18n/fontmake) to compile the UFO
sources to usable binaries (OTF, TTF, etc.).
